**General Notes**
As "Django Application Development with SQL and Databases" EDX-IBM course final project, an `onlinecourse` app is provided in this repo.<br/>

The project has been developed locally on VSCode IDE, and deployed to IBM Cloud Foundry:<br/>

https://pettib01.us-south.cf.appdomain.cloud/onlinecourse/<br/>

where you can see it working (a bit slow should I say).<br/>

Three courses with lessons and its  non exclusive multiple choice exams have been created, in addition some user have been signed up as instructor or as student.<br/>

A layout.html file is added with headings and nav bar, common to all templates, with context data just to change the "home link".<br/>

Feel free to signup as site user, and enroll yourself in any course. You can take an exam and see the results.<br/>

Code has several "print" (to terminal) instructions just for debugging purposes.<br/>
