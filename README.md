**General Notes**
As "Django Application Development with SQL and Databases" EDX-IBM course final project, an `onlinecourse` app is provided in this repo.
The project has been developed locally on VSCode IDE, and deployed to IBM Cloud Foundry:
https://pettib01.us-south.cf.appdomain.cloud/onlinecourse/
where you can see it working (a bit slow).
Three courses with lessons and its  non exclusive multiple choice exams have been created, in addition some user have been signed up as instructor or as student.
A layout.html file is added with headings and nav bar, common to all templates, with context data just to change the "home link".
 

Feel free to signup as site user, and enroll yourself in any course. You can take an exam and see the results.

Code has several "print" (to terminal) instructions just for debugging purposes.

**ER Diagram**
